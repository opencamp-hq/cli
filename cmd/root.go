This command line tool allows you to check whether a campground managed by
recreation.gov has any available sites. First search for the campground you're interested
in with 'opencamp search [campground]', and note the campground ID of the correct match.

Then check its availability with 'opencamp check [id] [start_date] [end_date]'. Note
that start_date and end_date should be in MM-DD-YYYY format. If there are any available
sites, we'll let you know.

Finally, you can continuously poll availability to see if any cancelations occur. Do
this with 'opencamp poll [id] [start_date] [end_date] --interval=10m.' The application will
run continuously and check availability (eg) every 10 minutes until a campsite becomes
available or today's date is passed the start_date.
